# UE5.0.3FPTemplate
 For the people who are trying to use the UE First Person template since in 5.1 onwards the camera is broken, here's the 5.0.3 template with the functioning camera.

 To use it, just run the .exe and when the pop-up comes up, select the version of the engine you are using.

 NOTE: This template will not work with UE4. The First Person template works fine in that anyway...
